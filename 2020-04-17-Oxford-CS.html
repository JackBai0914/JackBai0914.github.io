<h4 id="In-comparison-to-Stanford-or-MIT-how-are-Oxford-and-Cambridge-in-computer-science"><a href="#In-comparison-to-Stanford-or-MIT-how-are-Oxford-and-Cambridge-in-computer-science" class="headerlink" title="In comparison to Stanford or MIT, how are Oxford and Cambridge in computer science?"></a><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.quora.com/In-comparison-to-Stanford-or-MIT-how-are-Oxford-and-Cambridge-in-computer-science#">In comparison to Stanford or MIT, how are Oxford and Cambridge in computer science?</a></h4><blockquote>
<p>…<br>To rephrase that last paragraph, as an undergraduate you have some of the top experts in the world available for teaching in lectures, as well as the supervision system (tutorials in Oxford) which is the best in the world (please note: 2 supervisions per week, for an hour only, including preparation 10+ hours, but not a full week). You get to think, aloud, too.</p>
<p>So to try to summarize: my impression of MIT is that it teaches technologies and skills. Cambridge, on the other hand, introduces you to as many different important subjects as you can deal with, and although the exams are tough they are also somewhat forgiving, particularly for the diploma in my time.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="Should-I-apply-to-Cambridge-or-Oxford-for-computer-science"><a href="#Should-I-apply-to-Cambridge-or-Oxford-for-computer-science" class="headerlink" title="Should I apply to Cambridge or Oxford for computer science?"></a><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.quora.com/Should-I-apply-to-Cambridge-or-Oxford-for-computer-science">Should I apply to Cambridge or Oxford for computer science?</a></h4><blockquote>
<p>The two are characterized by their similarities far more than their differences, and the computer science courses of Oxford and Cambridge are pretty similar in structure. It’s hard to make an especially wrong choice here.</p>
<p>The most obvious difference is that Oxford has two joint honours degrees, Maths &amp; Computer Science and Computer Science &amp; Philosophy. Cambridge doesn’t offer any joint honours courses with computer science, but in your first year you can sit some papers from the Natural Sciences degree and/or a social psychology paper, or you can sit two maths papers your first year in the “Computer Science with Mathematics” choice.  This structural difference might be important to you. For me, the lack of a Maths &amp; Computer Science course at Cambridge made it an easy choice to apply to Oxford, and this was also true for many other people doing this course that I’ve talked to.</p>
<p>Another difference is the size of the departments. Cambridge takes around 90 undergraduates each year for Computer Science; Oxford takes about half of that (including the joint courses). As a consequence, Cambridge probably offers more courses/modules, simply due to the larger scale. On the flip side, the small size of the Oxford department gives it a quite cozy, friendly feel; it seems much more unified than the larger departments.</p>
<p>One significant difference is the actual courses available. It’s a bit dangerous to choose a university because of one or two specific courses, since these things can change and the courses could vanish. With that said, Cambridge has a bunch of more applied/“soft” options (Bioinformatics, Business Studies, E-Commerce, “Economics, Law, and Ethics”, Software Engineering, etc.) which you won’t find at Oxford. Cambridge also seems to have quite a few hardware-focused courses (ECAD and Architecture, Human-Computer Interaction, Computer Vision, System-on-Chip Design, Mobile and Sensor Systems, etc.) which you won’t really find at Oxford either. By contrast, Oxford’s department is very theory-focused— far more so than most or maybe even all American departments, for instance. That’s not to say Cambridge doesn’t have theoretical courses as well (it does, and quite a few of them at that). But it’s something you might keep in mind when deciding between the two.</p>
<p>But, of course, the academics are only one part of the picture. You should consider other factors too. I agree with the suggestion to visit the two if possible, and to also think about which college you’d apply to. I agree with Michael M. Ross that your college is the most important factor in your experience, simply because it’s the context in which most of your teaching and socializing will probably take place. But on the other hand, it’s pretty much impossible to predict what your college experience will be like. It’s also pretty hard to go wrong and you’ll end up loving whichever college you end up at. Because of that, I don’t think college choice is a very useful thing to consider that much. I wouldn’t worry about it unless you have specific concerns (want to play on a particular college sports team or something). The colleges at both universities are pretty comparable anyway.</p>
<p>As I said at the beginning of this answer, Oxford and Cambridge are overall very similar. You need to decide between them somehow, so of course consider all the factors. At the same time, I don’t think it’s something worth spending too much time stressing over.</p>
<p>Best of luck!</p>

<h4 id="What-is-it-like-to-study-computer-science-at-Oxford-University"><a href="#What-is-it-like-to-study-computer-science-at-Oxford-University" class="headerlink" title="What is it like to study computer science at Oxford University?"></a><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.quora.com/What-is-it-like-to-study-computer-science-at-Oxford-University">What is it like to study computer science at Oxford University?</a></h4><blockquote>
<p>It’s a mixed bag, in my opinion.</p>
<p>I, like most of my classmates, started Oxford computer science straight after school at age 18, so it comprised my first three years of independence as an adult. Living away from home in a pleasant setting with like-minded people was great. I learned a lot outside my discipline just from conversations over tea, which I really valued. The people I was with were the most similar to me of any group I’d been in before, but the collegiate structure of the University means that one lives with others studying a wide range of subjects, which keeps conversations interesting. It’s common to stay up into the early hours of the morning having a heated debate over some issue (abortion, free will, etc).</p>
<p>I think most of the standard positive points about university apply: I made good friends; I grew a lot personally, and so on. Oxford is also a great setting for all of this. The city is small enough to walk most places in well under ten minutes, and big enough that it feels like there are things going on other than the University.</p>
<p>The actual degree in computer science, however, is pretty poor, in my opinion. The lectures suffer the widely-recognised problems that are inherent to the format, but the Department of Computer Science goes one step further and provides, in most cases, LaTeX beamer slides read out in a monotone voice by someone who may or may not actually understand what they are reading (we know this from asking questions which other students can answer but the lecturer can’t).</p>
<p>The first year-and-a-bit of the course features one-on-two tutorials, the merits of which have been covered elsewhere, and which I also found valuable. Then, those tutorials are replaced by larger classes which range from “acceptable” to “total shambles”. In my second year I started the computer graphics course but quit after the classes turned out to be an absolute Comedy of Errors, with the teacher incapable of using even the simplest relevant techniques. For example, he couldn’t work out what matrices could be used to scale vectors! According to its own website, “Oxford’s intensive teaching style is intellectually challenging, and leads to a world-class education.” Not in the Department of Computer Science.</p>
<p>In the third year of the degree there is a research project where students work with members of the Department on original research. Credit where it’s due: this is great. I’ve heard stories of supervisors not replying to emails for weeks, ignoring the students they’re responsible for, but that didn’t happen to me — my supervisors were extremely professional, and, to be honest, were probably more on top of my project than I was (although I of course did the work).</p>
<p>Another issue with the degree itself is the price tag. In practical terms, this isn’t an issue (for the student, as long as they’re within the EU), because a student loan can cover the cost, and the terms ensure that students only ever pay the loan back at a rate they can afford. But charging £27,000 (about $42,000 as of July 2015) for a degree inexorably leads to it being viewed as a product, and I think it’s clear from the experiences I outlined above that the computer science degree represents unbelievably bad value for money. The fee works out to £375 per week, and I can’t see any way to reconcile that price with the quality on offer. A subtlety here is that Oxford computer science graduates are extremely employable, and earn a lot more money, on average, than those without a degree. But correlation doesn’t imply causation, and I think the employability has a lot more to do with being admitted by the University than it has to do with being taught by it.</p>
<p>Overall, I think if you can get an offer, and you take it up, you’ll probably have a fun, rewarding, and memorable three years, but I think that’s in spite of the formal teaching provisions, not because of them.</p>
<p>Without a doubt, studying Computer Science at Oxford has been the best experience of my life.</p>
<p>Oxford consistently ranks top 10 in the world for CS.  The course is amazing, the people are really fun and I’m going to make a ton of money.</p>
<p>The academic course</p>
<p>The 3 year Bachelor in CS course is incredibly well designed.  It doesn’t bend to the latest fad or fashion, instead, Oxford students are taught the principles behind whatever technology we’re using.  The idea is that if you need a new language, you can pick it up in an afternoon.  (This was super helpful when I started at Palantir and needed to learn CoffeeScript straight away).</p>
<p>Two-on-one tuition is the highlight of the Oxford experience: you meet with your incredibly knowledgable tutor on a weekly basis.  In a tutorial, you explore the most interesting questions from that week and the tutor hones in on anything you don’t understand. (These expand to 10-person classes for specialist subjects.)</p>
<p>Oxford teaches you computer science from day one and the course encompasses all facets of CS.  It covers functional programming, assembly code, concurrent algorithms, machine learning, linear algebra, compilers, OOP and networks just to name a few [full list here].</p>
<p>Oxford didn’t waste my time on things I could learn myself.  For example, there is no course on javascript or web development, there’s nothing on Objective-C or Swift.  Instead, Oxford teaches you what closures, pointers, garbage collection and heaps are so that when you want to learn a language, you already understand all the concepts.</p>
<p>At the end of the course, you can pretty much work wherever you want.  The Sunday Times found that Oxford computer scientists “were earning an average of £43,895 six months after graduating” [Sunday Times article].  You can get a silicon valley internship in your first summer and my friends have ended up at Palantir, Google, Facebook, Quora etc.</p>
<p>Life outside CS</p>
<p>Oxford colleges are basically Hogwarts houses.  I chose Magdalen, which accepts about 120 students a year (4 of whom study CS).  They provide meals and accommodation and have thriving clubs &amp; societies.  Magdalen is also stunningly beautiful.</p>
<p>Terms are 8 weeks long.  There are three terms in a year.  That means you have a ridiculous amount of vacation each year.</p>
<p>Unlike some American colleges, I have not been constantly subjected to tests that count towards my final grade.  Exams only come at the end of the year and the first year doesn’t count.  You have the freedom to do pretty much whatever you like as long as your tutor is happy with you.</p>
<p>I chose to train with Oxford Modern Pentathlon and spent roughly 18 hours a week training at the sports centre.  There’s student politics, journalism, music, drama, friendly-level sports and competitive university sports.</p>
<p>Studying at Oxford is no more expensive than any other university in the country – in many ways it’s actually cheaper with amazing support from the university and colleges [see Fees and funding].</p>

<p>Studying for my MSc Software Engineering at Oxford University was awesome. I would assume the same would be true of the Computer Science programme, but my experience relates to just the MSc Software Engineering programme.</p>
<p>Oxford University consistently ranks in ‘Top 10’ lists for Computer Science - e.g. No. 3 in the 2013 QS World University Rankings - Computer Science Most Popular in the QS World University Rankings by… — LONDON, May 7, 2013 /PR Newswire UK/ — (No.1 for Europe).</p>
<p>I was taught by some of the leading experts of our field, including learning ‘Service Orientated Architecture’ from the CTO of a leading global web services company (WSO2) who takes a week out from his company to teach the MSc module at Oxford. I learned ‘Agile Methods’ from an expert Agile coach who flies in from New Zealand just to teach at Oxford. I learned how to ‘Design for Security’ from experts, researchers and innovators in the field.  Each course was special in its own way. There is a good mix of experts from industry and academia.</p>
<p>Class sizes are small (typically around 10-12 people), often with 2 or 3 lecturers or guest lecturers for each module. This gives amble opportunity to ask questions and talk through ideas.</p>
<p>The MSc Software Engineering is a part-time programme, intended for professionals who already have some real-world experience in the field. It is common for students to fly over from the US and further afield to attend each module (10 modules + thesis make a MSc).</p>
<p>Oxford tends to draw the best talent - both in terms of lecturers and students - which makes for modules covering cutting-edge methods and technology, and great in-class discussions and perspectives based on real world experience from a range of sectors.</p>
<p>Oxford as a city is great for studying. There are many famous institutions such as the Oxford Union (with high-profile debates), many talks in the evenings on all kinds of topics throughout the academic week, and many atmospheric and historical pubs.</p>
<p>Studying at Oxford means being part of an Oxford College. My college (Kellogg) is a hub of social activity, great food, and great people.</p>
<p>I’ve met some fascinating people on the course, made valuable friends and connections, and have learned a number of new skills and technologies that I’ve already applied to various problems in various industries.  Since finishing my 10 modules, I’ve moved to Canada and set up a technology consulting corporation. I mostly work remotely, but typically fly to visit clients in various parts of the world a few times a year for on-site visits (including the university itself). It’s hard for me to quantify the economic benefits to me of studying at Oxford, but I’m fairly sure that it has helped me gain clients and take on interesting projects, and has increased my earning potential.</p>
<p>If I could turn back time, I would have applied to study my BSc at Oxford too.</p>

<p>I went from an American high school to an undergrad degree at Oxford, so I’ve thought about this a lot.</p>
<p>In summary: maybe. It depends.</p>
<p>There are some serious downsides to going to Oxford as an American:</p>
<p>No financial aid. You can still take out student loans, including US government loans, but you’re ineligible for Pell grants and you won’t receive any scholarship money from the university. Top US universities, by contrast, have very generous financial aid policies.<br>Inflexible course of study. You need to apply for a specific degree program, like a BA in History or an MPhys in physics, etc. In other words, you need to know what you want to major in when you apply, and it’ll be difficult or impossible to change that if you change your mind — depending on what you want to switch to, to switch courses you may need to start over as a first-year and possibly even reapply and reinterview.</p>
<p>Many American high school students haven’t put serious thought into what they want to major in, so they’d be a bad fit for this system.</p>
<p>No broad education. The liberal arts education you’d find in the US — a broad combination of requirements in the humanities and sciences intended to give everyone a well-rounded education — doesn’t exist at Oxford. Rather, you exclusively study your course of study. I did Maths &amp; Computer Science, so every single class I took was in maths or in computer science; there was not only no requirement but even no opportunity to take classes in things like English, economics, philosophy, etc. I think this is a shame.<br>It’s harder to maintain connections as a student… Oxford has pretty long vacations (six weeks around each of Christmas and Easter, and then the long vac in the summer is three months), and if you go home to the States for these it can feel like a bit of a drag on your friendships. Your friends will be making plans, hanging out, etc. over the breaks, which you’ll miss out on, and if you get into a relationship it’ll put strain on that.</p>
<p>My advice here in retrospect: don’t spend too much time at home, especially the Easter vac, which will be tremendously boring (your friends will return to college by two weeks in or so, leaving you with a month by yourself). Instead, try to aggressively make plans to be in the UK or traveling elsewhere.<br>…and even harder after you graduate. After graduating, I moved to Silicon Valley to come work at Quora, but all of my friends remain in the UK, especially in London. I can now expect to see my college friends a couple times a year at most from here on out. This sucks. It also makes life after graduation a bit more isolating; while most of my recently-graduated coworkers came with a ready-made extended network of friends and acquaintances in the Bay Area, I pretty much had to start all over from scratch, which isn’t fun.<br>You need to be more proactive with your career. Going from a US high school -&gt; UK undergrad is pretty rare, so you’ll have to worry about things you might not have otherwise. For example, if you want to go to a US graduate school, they place a higher emphasis on undergraduate research than UK universities do, and you’ll have to both 1) realize this yourself and 2) proactively work to overcome fewer opportunities being available.</p>
<p>For me working in tech, the culture is totally different in the US from in the UK. So I had to 1) realize I should be doing internships during my summers, 2) realize when and how to apply for them, 3) realize what opportunities are available/“good”. Seems easy written like this, but this is the kind of thing people passively assimilate from their peers which you miss out on. In particular, 1) none of my friends were working after their first year, so it didn’t even occur to me to get an internship then, 2) I didn’t apply for things my second year until January/February when already things were filling/filled up, and when I did apply almost nobody interviewed me, 3) it wasn’t until my third year that I had any sense of this at all, vs just applying to random companies I had heard of.</p>
<p>All of this is to say: studying in the UK as an American is rare, and you’ll have to do extra work to make up for it.<br>There are plenty of great things about going to Oxford too, of course. I’m not sure I’d give a blanket recommendation either way. But if you’re considering it, you should keep these things in mind.</p>

<p> It depends on your goals. I’m a final-year (although I could actually do another year if I wanted) computer science student and I spend less than 10 hours on university work, most weeks, and I’m (probably) working at a 2.1. (In my second year I worked like this and got 66%, a mid-2.1.)</p>
<p>I’m awake for roughly 16*7 = 112 hours a week, so that leaves about 100 hours. If I so chose, I’m sure I could squeeze in almost as much gaming as I wanted next to my other activities, like eating, socialising, and learning things I actually care about. I, like Peter, think this would be a bit of a waste of the Oxford environment, but it’s perfectly doable.</p>
<p>(Note to American readers: 2.1 here means an “upper second class”, not a GPA.)</p>
